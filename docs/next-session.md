# Next Session: Phase 2C Outreach Metering Removal

_Updated 2026-07-25. Read `AGENTS.md` and follow the Session Start Protocol in
`docs/project-operating-state.md` before editing._

## Session check

1. Run `git pull`.
2. Run `git status --short --branch`.
3. Confirm the active branch is `main`.
4. Read `docs/subscription-billing-production-plan-2026-07-24.md`.
5. Read `scripts/preflight-subscription-billing.sql` and the 2026-07-25 findings below.
6. Re-check production migration history immediately before any migration action.

## Unified pricing initiative state

The approved retail contract is:

- Smoldering: $22/month for 20 successful new Apply Wizard pursuits.
- Roaring: $32/month for 45 successful new Apply Wizard pursuits plus Markdown pursuit-history
  export.
- Roaring is the top plan.
- No free retail tier, one-time membership fee, rollover, or retail overages.
- A use is consumed only when a new pursuit atomically persists at least one useful contact.
- Failed, empty, cached, repeated, and revisited pursuits do not consume another use.
- The usage counter is quiet and appears only on deliberate Plan/Billing surfaces.
- Tester remains an internal access-code entitlement outside the retail plan matrix.

### Codex Phase 1: committed and production schema confirmed

Commit `3a3453d` is on `origin/main`. It added provider cost telemetry, safe rate-card estimation,
source-content reuse, posting-refinement backoff, extraction claims, and the first unit-economics
report.

The 2026-07-25 read-only production preflight directly confirmed these migration files are applied
and recorded in production:

- `20260724000200_provider_usage_events.sql`
- `20260724000300_jobs_source_content_hash.sql`
- `20260724000400_posting_refinement_backoff.sql`
- `20260724000500_job_link_extraction_claims.sql`

The same query confirmed the expected Phase 1 schema objects. This live database evidence
supersedes the earlier note that the four migrations were unapplied. A real production
unit-economics baseline still requires provider events accumulated after deployment.

Known Phase 1 limitations:

- An already-ingested URL is not refetched merely because its remote content later changes.
- Identical content arriving concurrently at different URLs can still produce duplicate provider
  work.

### Claude pricing design: approved and synced

Commit `c536002` contains five approved pricing/billing design cards. They were registered with the
Claude Design project and mirrored into the repository:

- `design-system/components/homepage-pricing.html`
- `design-system/components/plan-billing-step.html`
- `design-system/components/plan-billing-detail.html`
- `design-system/components/apply-wizard.html`
- `design-system/components/export.html`
- `design-system/_ds_manifest.json`

The approved designs cover:

- two-tier homepage pricing;
- plan acquisition, checkout return, access-code, active, canceled, and unavailable states;
- quiet Profile Plan/Billing usage, upgrade, downgrade, cancellation, and payment-recovery states;
- Apply Wizard zero-use, inactive-payment, and final-use exception states;
- Roaring Markdown export and Smoldering locked states.

These are design-system sources only. Production UI, CSS, public copy, and legal pages have not
been ported. Any production port must map exactly to these approved cards and follow the full
design-sync checklist.

### Codex Phase 2A: committed and applied to production

Phase 2A added:

- `supabase/migrations/20260724000600_subscription_billing_two_tier.sql`
- `scripts/test-subscription-billing-two-tier-migration.sh`
- the `test:migrations:subscription-billing` package command;
- automatic inclusion of that harness in `release:check`.

The migration contract:

- sets `basic` to Smoldering at $22/20/no Markdown;
- sets `premium` to Roaring at $32/45/Markdown;
- preserves tester at 25 uses with internal Roaring-equivalent capability;
- retires `pro` from new entitlement;
- adds subscription source and Stripe-ready lifecycle fields;
- backfills existing non-Stripe tester and premium rows as `access_code`, following Randall's
  2026-07-25 legacy-account decision; other pre-Stripe rows remain `manual`;
- prevents access-code writes from replacing a Stripe subscription;
- removes the database fallback that treated a missing subscription as active `basic`;
- adds the authoritative `apply_wizard` usage type, lifetime one-use-per-pursuit uniqueness, and
  immutable pursuit latch;
- backfills only pursuits with persisted useful contacts;
- adds service-role-only atomic access-code redemption;
- adds service-role-only atomic Human Path contact, event, debit, and latch persistence;
- preserves legacy pursuit, Human Path, and outreach write behavior for the application cutover;
- keeps authenticated contact reads while making contact mutations service-role-only;
- uses Stripe half-open billing periods and UTC calendar months for access-code/manual
  entitlements;
- discards raw provider contact and diagnostic fields outside the allowlist.

Verification passed:

- three idempotent migration applications;
- exact catalog, preservation, backfill, security, period, debit, empty-result, and replay checks;
- Stripe source and billing-period fail-closed checks;
- tester UTC renewal regression;
- legacy Saved Pursuits migration harness;
- 32 fixture suites;
- typecheck;
- lint with four pre-existing warnings and zero errors;
- production build;
- full `npm run release:check`.

The migration was applied and recorded on 2026-07-25 after the verification and authorization
documented below. The Phase 2B runtime calls the new RPCs only behind the disabled production flag.

### Codex Phase 2B: deployed with billing false

The application compatibility bridge is committed as `b76e7f8`, pushed to `origin/main`, and
deployed successfully by Vercel. GitHub Actions run `30178555166` passed. `BILLING_ENABLED` is
absent from the production environment, so it resolves false and the legacy paths remain active.

Implemented behavior:

1. Schema-aware subscription types and database mapping cover plan source, Stripe lifecycle,
   Apply Wizard allowance/usage, periods, and Markdown entitlement.
2. Enabled missing subscriptions fail closed; the false path retains the active-basic fallback.
3. Enabled enforcement uses database plan entitlements; the false path retains `PLAN_RULES`.
4. Enabled access-code redemption uses `redeem_access_code_subscription`.
5. Enabled Human Path uses `apply_wizard` preflight and the atomic
   `persist_human_path_generation` RPC.
6. Structured RPC results cover limit, inactive, replay, contacts, pursuit, usage, invalid period,
   invalid state, and visibility outcomes.
7. Stripe periods fail closed; access-code/manual periods derive from the current UTC month.
8. The false path keeps legacy access-code, Human Path, pursuit, and outreach behavior.
9. Outreach debits and production UI remain unchanged.

Changed application and test files:

- `.env.example`
- `lib/public-profile/subscription/types.ts`
- `lib/public-profile/subscription/repository.ts`
- `lib/public-profile/subscription/enforcement.ts`
- `lib/account/access-codes.ts`
- `lib/public-profile/pursuits/types.ts`
- `lib/public-profile/pursuits/repository.ts`
- `lib/public-profile/api.ts`
- `scripts/test-account-access-codes.ts`
- `scripts/test-account-access-codes.mjs`
- `scripts/test-public-profile-subscription.ts`
- `scripts/test-public-profile-pursuits.ts`
- `scripts/test-public-profile-api.ts`
- `scripts/test-fixtures.mjs`
- `package.json`

Verification passed:

- Phase 2A migration harness;
- legacy Saved Pursuits migration harness;
- 33 fixture suites;
- typecheck;
- lint with four pre-existing warnings and zero errors;
- production build;
- `git diff --check`.

## Production migration and postflight result

The aggregate-only read-only preflight ran on 2026-07-25:

- migrations `20260724000200` through `20260724000500` are recorded and their schema is present;
- at preflight time, only `20260724000600` was missing;
- production has three active `premium` subscriptions;
- production has one premium access code with 12 recorded uses;
- production has no durable per-user link from an access-code redemption to a subscription;
- before Randall's decision, migration `00600` would have classified the three premium
  subscriptions as `manual`;
- 10 contact-backed Apply Wizard uses, all for one user and all in the current UTC month, qualify
  for the migration backfill.

Randall selected internal `access_code` entitlement treatment on 2026-07-25. Migration `00600`
now backfills existing non-Stripe `tester` and `premium` subscriptions as `access_code`; other
pre-Stripe plans remain `manual`. Its isolated harness includes a legacy premium fixture. The
focused harness and full local release check passed after this change: three idempotent migration
applications, the Saved Pursuits harness, 33 fixture suites, typecheck, lint with four pre-existing
warnings and zero errors, and the production build.

After a fresh preflight and explicit authorization, migration `00600` was applied and recorded on
2026-07-25. `scripts/postflight-subscription-billing.sql` confirmed:

- the expected Smoldering, Roaring, tester, and retired pro catalog;
- three active premium subscriptions classified as `access_code`;
- 10 unit Apply Wizard backfill rows for 10 distinct pursuits and one user;
- zero duplicate, malformed, debit-without-latch, or latch-without-debit rows;
- all expected schema fields and both atomic RPCs;
- service-role-only execution for code redemption and Human Path persistence.

Randall authorized the controlled flag-on verification. The first attempt failed before
authentication or a provider call because the disposable fixture referenced two profile columns
removed by the redesign. Cleanup returned zero, the flag was removed, and a rollback deployment
completed. The corrected seed-only rehearsal passed while flag-off. The approved retry then passed:

- premium access-code plan read;
- atomic `already_entitled` code response without consuming a code use;
- Roaring export entitlement;
- 23 persisted Human Path contacts;
- one unit Apply Wizard debit, one event, and one pursuit latch;
- 1 of 45 used with 44 remaining;
- cached replay with no additional provider call;
- zero legacy Human Path debits;
- zero disposable rows after cleanup.

`BILLING_ENABLED` remains enabled in Production. The aggregate postflight still shows the three
real premium access-code subscriptions and 10 historical Apply Wizard rows, with no malformed,
duplicate, or unmatched rows.

The checked-in QA harness is `scripts/qa-subscription-flag-on-production.mjs`. Its final local
release check passed both migration harnesses, all 33 fixture suites, typecheck, lint with four
pre-existing warnings and zero errors, and the production build.

## Immediate next task: complete Phase 2 metering cutover

The approved product contract has one retail counter. Two legacy outreach-side behaviors remain:

1. `persist_initial_outreach_generation` can still create the retired one-time `pursuit` debit.
2. Initial outreach still enforces the retired retail `outreach_message` quota.

Implement this as a new post-`00600` migration and a narrow compatibility update. Do not edit or
re-record the already-applied migration `00600`. Preserve:

- atomic and idempotent initial outreach persistence;
- one initial message per selected contact;
- one regeneration per message;
- historical `pursuit`, `human_path`, and `outreach_message` rows for audit;
- provider/model telemetry.

Add isolated PostgreSQL regression coverage proving new outreach writes create no pursuit or
outreach retail debit and cannot bypass the Apply Wizard latch. Run the full release check, deploy
compatibly, apply the new migration only after a fresh preflight and explicit authorization, and
repeat authenticated production verification.

## Explicitly still incomplete

- A real production unit-economics baseline after post-deploy provider events exist.
- Outreach entitlement cutover and removal of new retail pursuit/outreach debits.
- Stripe test products, Checkout, Customer Portal, webhook processing, lifecycle tests, and
  environment secrets.
- Markdown pursuit-history export backend.
- Port of Claude’s approved cards to production surfaces.
- Terms, Privacy, Billing, and Support updates plus the legal-counsel checkpoint.
- Test-mode end-to-end billing verification and production release authorization.

## Production safety boundary

Do not disable `BILLING_ENABLED`, configure live Stripe, or edit protected production UI/copy
without new explicit scope. Production uses the database-backed entitlement and atomic Apply
Wizard paths. Stripe Checkout, Portal, and webhooks are not built; flag-on does not make the
payment system Stripe-ready.
