# Next Session: Migration 00600 Verification and Authorization

_Updated 2026-07-25. Read `AGENTS.md` and follow the Session Start Protocol in
`docs/project-operating-state.md` before editing._

## Session check

1. Run `git pull`.
2. Run `git status --short --branch`.
3. Confirm the active branch is `main`.
4. Read `docs/subscription-billing-production-plan-2026-07-24.md`.
5. Read `scripts/preflight-subscription-billing.sql` and the 2026-07-25 findings below.
6. Re-check production migration history immediately before any migration action.

## Unified pricing initiative state

The approved retail contract is:

- Smoldering: $22/month for 20 successful new Apply Wizard pursuits.
- Roaring: $32/month for 45 successful new Apply Wizard pursuits plus Markdown pursuit-history
  export.
- Roaring is the top plan.
- No free retail tier, one-time membership fee, rollover, or retail overages.
- A use is consumed only when a new pursuit atomically persists at least one useful contact.
- Failed, empty, cached, repeated, and revisited pursuits do not consume another use.
- The usage counter is quiet and appears only on deliberate Plan/Billing surfaces.
- Tester remains an internal access-code entitlement outside the retail plan matrix.

### Codex Phase 1: committed and production schema confirmed

Commit `3a3453d` is on `origin/main`. It added provider cost telemetry, safe rate-card estimation,
source-content reuse, posting-refinement backoff, extraction claims, and the first unit-economics
report.

The 2026-07-25 read-only production preflight directly confirmed these migration files are applied
and recorded in production:

- `20260724000200_provider_usage_events.sql`
- `20260724000300_jobs_source_content_hash.sql`
- `20260724000400_posting_refinement_backoff.sql`
- `20260724000500_job_link_extraction_claims.sql`

The same query confirmed the expected Phase 1 schema objects. This live database evidence
supersedes the earlier note that the four migrations were unapplied. A real production
unit-economics baseline still requires provider events accumulated after deployment.

Known Phase 1 limitations:

- An already-ingested URL is not refetched merely because its remote content later changes.
- Identical content arriving concurrently at different URLs can still produce duplicate provider
  work.

### Claude pricing design: approved and synced

Commit `c536002` contains five approved pricing/billing design cards. They were registered with the
Claude Design project and mirrored into the repository:

- `design-system/components/homepage-pricing.html`
- `design-system/components/plan-billing-step.html`
- `design-system/components/plan-billing-detail.html`
- `design-system/components/apply-wizard.html`
- `design-system/components/export.html`
- `design-system/_ds_manifest.json`

The approved designs cover:

- two-tier homepage pricing;
- plan acquisition, checkout return, access-code, active, canceled, and unavailable states;
- quiet Profile Plan/Billing usage, upgrade, downgrade, cancellation, and payment-recovery states;
- Apply Wizard zero-use, inactive-payment, and final-use exception states;
- Roaring Markdown export and Smoldering locked states.

These are design-system sources only. Production UI, CSS, public copy, and legal pages have not
been ported. Any production port must map exactly to these approved cards and follow the full
design-sync checklist.

### Codex Phase 2A: committed, not applied to production

Phase 2A added:

- `supabase/migrations/20260724000600_subscription_billing_two_tier.sql`
- `scripts/test-subscription-billing-two-tier-migration.sh`
- the `test:migrations:subscription-billing` package command;
- automatic inclusion of that harness in `release:check`.

The migration contract:

- sets `basic` to Smoldering at $22/20/no Markdown;
- sets `premium` to Roaring at $32/45/Markdown;
- preserves tester at 25 uses with internal Roaring-equivalent capability;
- retires `pro` from new entitlement;
- adds subscription source and Stripe-ready lifecycle fields;
- backfills existing non-Stripe tester and premium rows as `access_code`, following Randall's
  2026-07-25 legacy-account decision; other pre-Stripe rows remain `manual`;
- prevents access-code writes from replacing a Stripe subscription;
- removes the database fallback that treated a missing subscription as active `basic`;
- adds the authoritative `apply_wizard` usage type, lifetime one-use-per-pursuit uniqueness, and
  immutable pursuit latch;
- backfills only pursuits with persisted useful contacts;
- adds service-role-only atomic access-code redemption;
- adds service-role-only atomic Human Path contact, event, debit, and latch persistence;
- preserves legacy pursuit, Human Path, and outreach write behavior for the application cutover;
- keeps authenticated contact reads while making contact mutations service-role-only;
- uses Stripe half-open billing periods and UTC calendar months for access-code/manual
  entitlements;
- discards raw provider contact and diagnostic fields outside the allowlist.

Verification passed:

- three idempotent migration applications;
- exact catalog, preservation, backfill, security, period, debit, empty-result, and replay checks;
- Stripe source and billing-period fail-closed checks;
- tester UTC renewal regression;
- legacy Saved Pursuits migration harness;
- 32 fixture suites;
- typecheck;
- lint with four pre-existing warnings and zero errors;
- production build;
- full `npm run release:check`.

The migration has not been applied to production. At the Phase 2A commit boundary, no application
runtime called the new RPCs; the local Phase 2B work below adds those calls behind a disabled flag.

### Codex Phase 2B: deployed with billing false

The application compatibility bridge is committed as `b76e7f8`, pushed to `origin/main`, and
deployed successfully by Vercel. GitHub Actions run `30178555166` passed. `BILLING_ENABLED` is
absent from the production environment, so it resolves false and the legacy paths remain active.

Implemented behavior:

1. Schema-aware subscription types and database mapping cover plan source, Stripe lifecycle,
   Apply Wizard allowance/usage, periods, and Markdown entitlement.
2. Enabled missing subscriptions fail closed; the false path retains the active-basic fallback.
3. Enabled enforcement uses database plan entitlements; the false path retains `PLAN_RULES`.
4. Enabled access-code redemption uses `redeem_access_code_subscription`.
5. Enabled Human Path uses `apply_wizard` preflight and the atomic
   `persist_human_path_generation` RPC.
6. Structured RPC results cover limit, inactive, replay, contacts, pursuit, usage, invalid period,
   invalid state, and visibility outcomes.
7. Stripe periods fail closed; access-code/manual periods derive from the current UTC month.
8. The false path keeps legacy access-code, Human Path, pursuit, and outreach behavior.
9. Outreach debits and production UI remain unchanged.

Changed application and test files:

- `.env.example`
- `lib/public-profile/subscription/types.ts`
- `lib/public-profile/subscription/repository.ts`
- `lib/public-profile/subscription/enforcement.ts`
- `lib/account/access-codes.ts`
- `lib/public-profile/pursuits/types.ts`
- `lib/public-profile/pursuits/repository.ts`
- `lib/public-profile/api.ts`
- `scripts/test-account-access-codes.ts`
- `scripts/test-account-access-codes.mjs`
- `scripts/test-public-profile-subscription.ts`
- `scripts/test-public-profile-pursuits.ts`
- `scripts/test-public-profile-api.ts`
- `scripts/test-fixtures.mjs`
- `package.json`

Verification passed:

- Phase 2A migration harness;
- legacy Saved Pursuits migration harness;
- 33 fixture suites;
- typecheck;
- lint with four pre-existing warnings and zero errors;
- production build;
- `git diff --check`.

## Production preflight result and resolved decision

The aggregate-only read-only preflight ran on 2026-07-25:

- migrations `20260724000200` through `20260724000500` are recorded and their schema is present;
- only `20260724000600` is missing;
- production has three active `premium` subscriptions;
- production has one premium access code with 12 recorded uses;
- production has no durable per-user link from an access-code redemption to a subscription;
- before Randall's decision, migration `00600` would have classified the three premium
  subscriptions as `manual`;
- 10 contact-backed Apply Wizard uses, all for one user and all in the current UTC month, qualify
  for the migration backfill.

Randall selected internal `access_code` entitlement treatment on 2026-07-25. Migration `00600`
now backfills existing non-Stripe `tester` and `premium` subscriptions as `access_code`; other
pre-Stripe plans remain `manual`. Its isolated harness includes a legacy premium fixture. The
focused harness and full local release check passed after this change: three idempotent migration
applications, the Saved Pursuits harness, 33 fixture suites, typecheck, lint with four pre-existing
warnings and zero errors, and the production build.

Immediate sequence:

1. commit and push the migration decision;
2. confirm CI and the flag-off Vercel deployment;
3. rerun `scripts/preflight-subscription-billing.sql`;
4. request explicit authorization before applying and recording migration `00600`;
5. postflight the schema, catalog, subscription sources, and Apply Wizard backfill;
6. only then enable billing for an approved production verification.

## Explicitly still incomplete

- Production proof of the enabled Human Path path against migration `00600`.
- A real production unit-economics baseline after post-deploy provider events exist.
- Outreach entitlement cutover and removal of new retail pursuit/outreach debits.
- A fresh read-only production preflight immediately before migration authorization.
- Production application and recording of migration `20260724000600`.
- Stripe test products, Checkout, Customer Portal, webhook processing, lifecycle tests, and
  environment secrets.
- Markdown pursuit-history export backend.
- Port of Claude’s approved cards to production surfaces.
- Terms, Privacy, Billing, and Support updates plus the legal-counsel checkpoint.
- Test-mode end-to-end billing verification and production release authorization.

## Production safety boundary

Do not apply migration `20260724000600`, enable `BILLING_ENABLED`, configure live Stripe, or edit
protected production UI/copy without new explicit scope. The current production application
continues to use the legacy entitlement and metering paths. The deployed route checks were
non-mutating only; no authenticated provider-costing Human Path run was performed.
